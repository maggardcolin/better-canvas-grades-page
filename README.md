# Canvas Class Average Chrome Extension
- Chrome extension that calculates and displays the mean and median grades for a given class, useful for determining your relative position in classes that are curved.
- I am *not* going to implement dropped grades in the calculations because there is no way to know which assignments are dropped by your classmates, so take the cutoffs/range text with a grain of salt if your class uses assignment drops.
- The range text under your total grade is based on the median, not the mean.
